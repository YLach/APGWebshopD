# APGWebShop

JavaEE Web Application : a webshop for gnomes composed of two interfaces (admin | customer).

Main features : inventory management, shopping cart management, users management.

Here is the list of programming technologies used for implementation:
- JavaSE 8
- JavaEE 7
  - JSF 2.2 + Facelets = view
  - EclipseLink JPA 2.1 (Derby DB) = persistency 
  - EJB 3.0 = business logic
  - Primefaces 5.0 = UI framework
- GlassFish Server 4.1.1 = application server

The GUI is really basic and should be enhanced in the future.
